# About me.

I am currently a Post-Doctoral researcher in the [Data Science department](http://www.eurecom.fr/data/) at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/), in the Data2Knowledge group.
I recently defended my PhD thesis, realised under the supervision of [RaphaÃ«l Troncy](http://www.eurecom.fr/~troncy), with the title _Knowledge-based music recommendation: Models, algorithms and exploratory search_.

My research fields involves [Semantic Web](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) technologies, [Knowledge Engineering](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering) and [Recommendation System](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system).

Since 2019, I am working on the [ANTRACT project](https://antract.hypotheses.org/).
